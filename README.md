My GitHub Universe Badge

At GitHub Universe 2024, attendees are given [hackable badges](https://gh.io/badger). This is my custom badge, featuring a QR code to [Wave Terminal](https://waveterm.dev), our logo, and some info about me.

## Setup

Setting this up was a real pain, involving bricking two separate badges. I got connected by following [this guide](git@github.com:esimkowitz/badger.git).

Copy the whole `evan` directory into the `/` root of the badge-OS filesystem. Copy `evan.py` and `icon-evan.jpg` into the `/examples` directory.
